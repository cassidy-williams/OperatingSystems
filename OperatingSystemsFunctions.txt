One function of the operating system is managing processes.
The operating system tells the CPU how much energy and resources to give to each program, process, or device.
When the user closes a program, the operating system tells the processer to stop giving resources to that program.
If you have multiple programs and files open, the operating system tells the processor how much and what resources to give to each program.
